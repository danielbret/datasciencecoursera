## Housekeeping
#  Clean up RStudio
rm(list=ls())

## Loading and preprocessing the data
#  Import data into R using the read.csv() function
#  The input file is in the working directory
#  Transform the Date value
activity_data <- read.csv('Activity.csv', header=TRUE, sep=',', na.strings='NA', colClasses = c(date = "Date"))

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day (ignoring missing values)? 
#  Aggregate the data to calculate total number of steps taken per day
TotalSteps <- with(activity_data, aggregate(steps, by=list(date), sum))
#  Create a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day

## Imputing missing values
#  Calculate the total number of missing values in the data set

#  The strategy for filling in all missing values is to use the mean number of steps taken per interval, 
#  which is recalculated here using the tapply function

# Confirm that all missing values have been filled with an imputed value

#  Aggregate the data to calculate total number of steps taken per day
TotalSteps2 <- with(activity_impute, aggregate(steps, by=list(date), sum))
#  Create a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day

     main = "Histogram (Including Imputed Data)", 
     xlab = "Total Number of Steps per Day", 
     ylab = "Frequency",

mean_steps2 <- mean(TotalSteps2$x,   na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps2
median_steps2 <- median(TotalSteps2$x, na.rm = TRUE)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
#  Create a factor variable with two levels:  "weekday" and "weekend"
library(dplyr)
activity_data <- mutate(activity_data, daytype = ifelse(weekdays(activity_data$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(activity_data$date) == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))

#  Aggregate the data to calculate the mean number of steps taken per interval
IntervalSteps3 <- with(activity_data, aggregate(steps, by=list(daytype,interval), na.rm=TRUE, mean))
#  Create a panel plot of the time series plot
library(lattice)
xyplot(x ~ Group.2 | factor(Group.1),
      layout = c(1, 2),
      main = "Panel Plot - Weekends vs. Weekdays", 
      xlab = "Interval Values",
